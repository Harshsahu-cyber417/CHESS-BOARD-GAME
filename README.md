# CHESS-BOARD-GAME
A complete chess game with all pieces and standard chess rules
Chess vs AI (JavaScript) is a simple browser-based chess game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player controls the White pieces and plays against an AI opponent with multiple difficulty levels: Beginner, Easy, Medium, Hard, and Very Hard.

The game includes:

A visual 8×8 chessboard with Unicode chess pieces

Click-to-move controls with legal move hints (green dots)

Basic chess rules for all pieces (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King)

Pawn promotion to Queen

A simple game-over detection when a king is captured

An AI powered by a Minimax algorithm with different search depths based on difficulty

A material-based evaluation system to decide the best moves

This project is great for learning game logic, DOM manipulation, and basic AI algorithms in JavaScript, and it runs directly in the browser without any external libraries.
